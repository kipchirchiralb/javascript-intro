// Callback functions - HOF

// A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after some operation is completed. In JavaScript, callback functions are commonly used in asynchronous operations, event handling, and higher-order functions (HOFs).
// A higher-order function (HOF) is a function that takes another function as an argument or returns a function as its result. HOFs are used to create more abstract and reusable code, allowing for greater flexibility in programming.
