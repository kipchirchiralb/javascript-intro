// Varables store data in memory(RAM) for use the application

// Varables are defined using the 'var', 'let', or 'const' keywords
// A variable stores a value that can be referenced and manipulated in your code//app

var username = "albert_(089675e67";

const PI = 3.142;

let age = 2025 - 2004;

// console.log(value) is a method to output/show the value to the browser console/terminal
age = 90;
console.log(age);
console.log(username);

console.log(PI * 2);

// var is an old way of declaring variables that was replace with const and let to make code less vulnerable to bugs

// const is used to declare constant/non-changing variables e.g. in your application, PI will never change

// let is used to declare variables that can be assigned new values as the user interacts with the application.

// In summary, using 'const' for constants and 'let' for variables that may change helps improve code stability and readability.

// Always remember to use meaningful variable names that reflect their purpose in your code. Do not use generic names like 'x' or 'temp' to enhance maintainability and make your code easier to understand.

let temp = 90; // not the best

let roomTemparature = 90; // better -- be descriptive while naming variables
